1.Used algorithm of this project
It is simple search algorithm.

2.Describe algorithm


(1) Put the initial node into the open list.(Open list is non visited node)
(2) Pop a node(x) a front of open list.(If open list is empty, it finishes.)
(3) Get child nodes of x. Put x into the closed list.(closed list is visited node.)
(4) Add pointers to x for items not included in the Closed List and add them to the openlist.
(5) Return step2.


3.Explain the meaning of result.

 
Search algorithm is implemented by node expantion.
